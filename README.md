# 681-research-simulations

This project looks to analyze the trade-offs between accuracy and real-time performance in physics simulations. Below are the scenarios that we test:

### Numerical Integration with Motion
Methods to Test:
- Euler Integration
- Verlet Integration
- Runge-Kutta

### Collision Detection
Methods to Test:
- Brute Force
- Bounding Volume Hierarchy
- Spatial Partitioning
- Separating Axis Theorem

### Fluid Simulation
Methods to Test:
- Eularian Grid
- Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
- Stable Fluids (Jos Stam)
